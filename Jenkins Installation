Jenkins is a Java application, so the first step is to install Java. Run the following command to install the OpenJDK 8 package:

sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

The current version of Jenkins does not support Java 10 (and Java 11) yet. If you have multiple versions of Java installed on your machine make sure Java 8 is the default Java version.

The next step is to enable the Jenkins repository. To do that, import the GPG key using the following curl command:

curl --silent --location http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo

And add the repository to your system with:

sudo rpm --import https://jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins-ci.org.key

Once the repository is enabled, install the latest stable version of Jenkins by typing:

sudo yum install jenkins

After the installation process is completed, start the Jenkins service with:

sudo systemctl start jenkins

To check whether it started successfully run:

systemctl status jenkins

You should see something similar to this:

‚óè jenkins.service - LSB: Jenkins Automation Server
Loaded: loaded (/etc/rc.d/init.d/jenkins; bad; vendor preset: disabled)
Active: active (running) since Thu 2018-09-20 1421 UTC; 15s ago
    Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)
Process: 2367 ExecStart=/etc/rc.d/init.d/jenkins start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
CGroup: /system.slice/jenkins.service

Finally enable the Jenkins service to start on system boot.

sudo systemctl enable jenkins

jenkins.service is not a native service, redirecting to /sbin/chkconfig.
Executing /sbin/chkconfig jenkins on
